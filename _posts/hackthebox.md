After my last post [attack-map](https://edwin.computer/attack-map), that project might seem a bit unrelated to my other projects and that is true. My real intrest stems from one day becoming paranoid that my server was going to be DDoSed or I did not have a secure machine.

I took a computer security course. From this course I learned how things can be vulnerable and how we can tell when these things are vulnerable.

The main arsenal of tools I use:

- Kali Linux(in a VM)
- Bash,Python, nmap, burp

We started the course by going over networking basics such as TCP packets, RFC's for REST API, different ports that use what.

One of my favorite movies on computer security, [Zero Days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_Days).
