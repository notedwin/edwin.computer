- You can use Touch ID to authenticate `sudo` on macOS. Check out this [Stack Exchange post](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/259093/can-touch-id-on-mac-authenticate-sudo-in-terminal/355880) for more details.

- Spotify limits the number of recently played tracks you can view to 50. If you want to know more, refer to this [Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56061606/spotify-api-recently-played-paging). Lastfm lets you do this search however, most people don't want to sign up for another platform :)

- In PostgreSQL, you can create functions. As an example, I created a function to validate JSON. See this [Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30187554/how-to-verify-a-string-is-valid-json-in-postgresql) for guidance.
