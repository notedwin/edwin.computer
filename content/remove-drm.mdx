> Why remove DRM? Aren't you stealing money from someone/ Isn't that Illegal? **No, It isn't**

### Table of Contents

### What is DRM?

DRM is a digital rights management system that prevents unauthorized access to digital content.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management)

### what is Adobe Digital Editions?

Adobe Digital Editions is a software package that allows you to read ebook in different formats such as .acsm, .epub, .pdf and etc.

### What are you removing DRM from?

I had a course in university that required a book from an independent publisher. The publisher sold a adobe digital editions version of the book for cheaper than the physical book. As a college student, saving 15 dollars is always a good idea. Also, I didn't want to carry a book around everyday.

### Why remove DRM?

What I didn't realize was that the book was DRM protected. I could only read the book on adobe digital editions and only on one computer.

This sucked and was limiting since I wanted to read the book on my Linux machine. I could have used a windows virtual machine but I didn't want to do that. I did not want to use a 10 year old version of digital editions to read a book everyday. I figured there must be a way to convert the file to a pdf.

### Enter DeDRM

After a couple of hours of research, I found a tool to remove DRM from books called DeDRM.

The tool is written in Python2 and relies on Adobe digital editions 2.0.

Using the adobe digital editions file (.acsm), DeDRM generates the adobe keys. These adobe keys are necessary to help decrypt the file.

BAM! you now have a an adobe digital editions book in pdf format.

I don't know too much about the process but it did work. I was able to read the book on my Linux machine.
So I wanted to share this.
