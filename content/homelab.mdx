## what does my homelab look like?

The hardware I used hasn't changed in 2 years.
I used some used dell optiplex's (9020m, 7060)

New software additions:

- [beszel](https://beszel.dev/)
- [glance](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance)
- healthchecks
- immich
- infisical - use .env, im just knees deep
- memos

No more:
motioneye, openwrt, dagster, grafana, filestash, homepage

Main reason for ditching the services above is they either added unneeded complexity and/or i did not use them!

check out the ansible code for more details: [ansible-compose](https://github.com/notedwin/ansible-compose)

## Other additions

For Christmas I explored using individually addressable LED again, using a wled controller.
I switched from a thrifted openwrt router to a new router, performance gain was negligible for me.
I should have read this before buying [wiisfi](https://www.wiisfi.com/)

## Next goals

Do I want a small rack? yes
Do I want more ubiquiti stuff? yes
Do I want to spend that money? no

I plan on setting up an all-in-one server that will act as a

- NAS, media server and gpu inference server
  This server will run proxmox with truenas.

I am waiting on some parts from aliexpress so maybe ill make another blogpost later.

## Why even spend time on a homelab?

I wont go into too much detail about the benefit of each individual service.
However, I will talks about the general benefits of a homelab for me.

Tinkering with these things helps me make tradeoff's between time, exploration and cost.
Spending 20hrs saving 10 dollars is a bad choice!

Also, building things from hardware to final product helps me understand new things and build on knowledge I already have!
