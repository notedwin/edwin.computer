# All this is based on a hypothetical story. I would never do this, and you shouldn't either

When I was younger I enjoyed messing around with cosmetic modfiications to Android like [ClockworkMod](https://www.clockworkmod.com/) and playing cracked APKs of games like Need for Speed using Lucky Patcher.

I also enjoyed finding ways to avoid being cucked by big telecom (slowing my internet after 2GB). This was so easy 14 yr old me figure it out.

Changing my score in video games like subways surfers using a hex editor.

Standing in a corner of my house to get free wifi from xfinitywifi.
Then reseting my mac address every 30 seconds, since to get another free session.

ex.

1. `sudo macchanger -r {interface}{:bash}`
2. Connect and Login with random email and password.
3. repeat every 30 mins

all of this to say don't forget to have fun with computers!
