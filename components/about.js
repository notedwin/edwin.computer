          <p>Howdy!</p>
          <p>
            I am a senior studying Computer Science at
            <a href="https://www.iit.edu"> Illinois Tech</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am actively seeking an full-time software engineering position to
            start after December 2021.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the school semesters, I keep myself busy by working on
            multiple production Flask applications for Illinois Tech's Idea Shop
            which helps manage students at our campus maker space. If I am not
            working at the Idea Shop, I am working on personal projects or
            attending hackathons.
          </p>
          <p>
            Iâ€™m interested in improving the efficiency, scalability and security
            of back-end applications and infrastructure.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have multiple years of programming experience in Python and
            JavaScript. I love working with Python and Linux.
