What is Full-stack development?
----------------

Full-stack development is jargon for the process of creating a computer system or application, comprising both the front end and the back end. Usually these applications are available through the World Wide Web.

How should I get started with Full-stack development?
---------------  

Front end is what the user sees and interacts with. There are different methodologies of creating a front end. You will likely be working with UI/UX designers to create the front-end. Front-end is usually referred to as dumb which means it should have no logic related to functionality.

Back-end is what the user does not see. The catch is that the back-end is not only code. Back-end includes networks, security, performance and scalability and your favorite topic operating systems. Monitoring and logging are your friend.

My server gets about 100,000 ssh login requests per day from all around the world because I have my public IP open for this website. A easy firewall could prevent this but sometimes the risk is more fun than the solution.

Assuming you can make a simple HTML website, you can start by learning JavaScript. There are tons of [resources](#resources) to learn JavaScript. Coding things consistently is the most important thing.

Once you think you know JavaScript watch these videos.

OK welcome back.

Key takeaways:  
Start small and keep work consistent.  
Don't be afraid to switch it up and try new things.  

I thought I wanted to go into cyber-security as a freshman. My sophomore year I thought I wanted to go into data science. As a junior,I enjoyed web development and thought about become a full-stack developer.  
Currently, I am focused on how I can keep applications and devices secure through secure development process and deployment through deep and wide knowledge in other areas.(This is probably going to change as well)

Enough Talk: What projects should I do?
-------------

Truly depends on what interests you.  
I first messed around with the spotify API to show what I was listening to on my first website.  
Then I made a eCommerce website in Django as final project for one of my classes. 
Then I skipped JavaScript and tried to learn a JavaScript framework without any JavaScript, which i failed hard. More specifically I wanted to make a portfolio in Gatsby. It took 4 months of working 3 hours a day to get it working that could have been reduced to around 2 months if I learned JavaScript.

If I were to start from scratch I would probably first make a website you should make should be something simple in HTML and JavaScript that uses an API like to get you last played song on spotify.

Then go to a web JavaScript framework or start back-end programming. After that you can continue practicing and adding complexity.

You'll have an idea for a project if you are always coding.

Good Luck!

I believe that knowing what you don't know is a humbling place to start. This will show you what you don't know. You do not need to learn everything you could focus on one thing and become and expert in that specific area.
